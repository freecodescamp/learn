However, now, it stands for <strong>Hypertext Preprocessor<\/strong>. It&#8217;s a recursive acronym because the first word itself is also an acronym.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP was created by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rasmus_Lerdorf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rasmus Lerdorf<\/a> in 1994. It&#8217;s currently maintained by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.php.net\/credits.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PHP Development Team<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PHP is a server-side language<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you open a website on your web browser, for example, https:\/\/www.CodeCamp<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web browser sends an HTTP request to a web server where CodeCamp locates. The web server receives the request and responds with an HTML document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, the web browser is a client while the web server is the server. The client requests for a page, and the server serves the request.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP runs on the web server, processes the request, and returns the HTML document. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PHP is a general-purpose language<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the purpose of the programming languages, there are two main types: domain-specific and general-purpose languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The domain-specific languages are used within specific application domains. For example, SQL is a domain-specific language. It&#8217;s used mainly for querying data from relational databases. And SQL cannot be used for other purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, PHP is a general-purpose language because PHP can develop various applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PHP is a cross-platform language<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP can run on all major operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use PHP with all leading web servers such as Nginx, OpenBSD, and Apache. Some cloud environments also support PHP like Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP is quite flexible. It&#8217;s not just limited to processing HTML. PHP has built-in support for generating PDF, GIF, JPEG, and PNG images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One notable feature of PHP is that it supports many databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, db2, Oracle Database, and MongoDB.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can PHP do<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP has two main applications:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Server-side scripting &#8211; PHP is well-suited for developing dynamic websites and web applications. <\/li><li>Command-line scripting  &#8211; like Python and Perl, you can run PHP script from the command line to perform administrative tasks like sending emails and generating PDF files.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The tutorials on this website mainly focus on server-side scripting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How PHP Works<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following illustrates how PHP works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"692\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.CodeCamp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/What-is-PHP-How-PHP-works.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-172\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.CodeCamp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/What-is-PHP-How-PHP-works.png 692w, https:\/\/www.CodeCamp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/What-is-PHP-How-PHP-works-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>How PHP works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>First, the web browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, e.g., index.php.<\/li><li>Second, the PHP preprocessor that locates on the web server processes PHP code to generate the HTML document.<\/li><li>Third, the web server sends the HTML document back to the web browser.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of PHP<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since PHP is designed for the web in the first place, it brings many advantages to web development:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Simple &#8211; PHP is quite easy to learn and get started. <\/li><li>Fast &#8211; PHP websites typically run very fast.<\/li><li>Stable &#8211; PHP is stable since it has been in existence for a long time.<\/li><li>Open-source and free &#8211; PHP is open source and free. It means that you don&#8217;t have to pay a license fee to use PHP to develop software products.<\/li><li>Community support &#8211; PHP has an active online community that helps you whenever you face an issue.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"helpful-block-content\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<header>\n\t\t<div class=\"wth-question\">Did you find this tutorial useful?<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wth-thumbs\">\n\t\t\t<button\n\t\t\t\tdata-post=\"169\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-post-url=\"https:\/\/www.CodeCamp\/php-tutorial\/what-is-php\/\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-post-title=\"What is PHP\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-response=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\tclass=\"wth-btn-rounded wth-yes-btn\"\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t<svg\n\t\t\t\t\txmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"\n\t\t\t\t\tviewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n\t\t\t\t\tfill=\"none\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke=\"currentColor\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke-width=\"2\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke-linecap=\"round\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"feather feather-thumbs-up block w-full h-full\"\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t<path\n\t\t\t\t\t\td=\"M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3\"\n\t\t\t\t\t><\/path>\n\t\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\"> Yes <\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/button>\n\n\t\t\t<button\n\t\t\t\tdata-response=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-post=\"169\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-post-url=\"https:\/\/www.CodeCamp\/php-tutorial\/what-is-php\/\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-post-title=\"What is PHP\"\n\t\t\t\tclass=\"wth-btn-rounded wth-no-btn\"\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t<svg\n\t\t\t\t\txmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"\n\t\t\t\t\tviewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n\t\t\t\t\tfill=\"none\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke=\"currentColor\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke-width=\"2\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke-linecap=\"round\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t<path\n\t\t\t\t\t\td=\"M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17\"\n\t\t\t\t\t><\/path>\n\t\t\t\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\"> No <\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/button>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/header>\n\n\t<div class=\"wth-form hidden\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wth-form-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wth-title\"><\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<textarea class=\"wth-message\"><\/textarea>\n\n\t\t\t<button class=\"btn btn-primary wth-btn-submit\">Send<\/button>\n\t\t\t<button class=\"btn wth-btn-cancel\">Cancel<\/button>\n\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summary: in this tutorial, you&#8217;ll learn about PHP, how it works, what it can do, and its advantages.
